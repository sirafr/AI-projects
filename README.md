# KNN
## Heart Disease Prediction Project
This project aims to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients using the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset used in this project contains various features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, and other medical attributes, which are used to train the predictive model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset. It consists of 918 instances and 12 attributes, including both numerical and categorical variables.

## Features
The features used for predicting heart disease include:

* Age
* Sex
* ChestPainType
* RestingBP (Resting Blood Pressure)
* Cholesterol
* FastingBS (Fasting Blood Sugar)
* RestingECG (Resting Electrocardiographic Results)
* MaxHR (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved)
* ExerciseAngina (Exercise Induced Angina)
* Oldpeak (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest)
* ST_Slope (Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment)
* HeartDisease

## Model
The predictive model is built using the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. KNN is a simple, non-parametric method used for classification tasks. It classifies new data points based on the majority class of their k nearest neighbors in the feature space.
